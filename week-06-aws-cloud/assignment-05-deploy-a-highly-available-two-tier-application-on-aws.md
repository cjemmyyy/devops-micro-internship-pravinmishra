# Assignment 5 — Deploy a Highly Available Two-Tier Application on AWS (VPC + ALB + ASG + Multi-AZ RDS)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will design and deploy a highly available two-tier web application on AWS: highly available networking across two Availability Zones, an Application Load Balancer, an Auto Scaling Group for the web tier, and a private Multi-AZ RDS database. You must prove high availability with real failure tests.

# Task 1 — Create HA Networking (VPC + 4 Subnets + IGW + NAT + Route Tables)

## Goal

Build a VPC (10.0.0.0/16) with two public and two private subnets across two Availability Zones, an Internet Gateway, a NAT Gateway, and the matching public/private route tables.

# Task 2 — Create Security Groups (ALB, EC2, RDS) with Least Privilege

## Goal

Create `ha-alb-sg` (HTTP public), `ha-web-sg` (HTTP only from `ha-alb-sg`, SSH from your IP), and `ha-db-sg` (database port only from `ha-web-sg`).

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — ALB Security Group inbound rules

---

#### Screenshot 8 — RDS Security Group inbound rule showing the database port allowed only from the EC2 Security Group

---

# Task 3 — Deploy Database Tier (RDS Multi-AZ in Private Subnets)

## Goal

Launch a private, Multi-AZ RDS database (MySQL or PostgreSQL) using the private DB Subnet Group and `ha-db-sg`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — RDS summary showing Multi-AZ = Yes and Publicly accessible = No

#### Screenshot 10 — RDS connectivity section showing the DB Subnet Group and Security Group

---

# Task 4 — Build a Launch Template (User Data Installs App + Connects to DB)

## Goal

Create a Launch Template whose user data installs the web-server runtime, deploys the application, configures the database connection, and starts the required services.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 11 — Launch Template details showing that user data exists, including a visible snippet

![](screenshots/ASS5-SC11.png)

---

#### Screenshot 12 — A running instance created from the template showing that the application responds on port 80 through a local test or browser using its public IP

![](screenshots/ASS5-SC12.png)

---

# Task 5 — Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) Across 2 Public Subnets

## Goal

Create an internet-facing ALB across both public subnets with an HTTP listener and a healthy instance target group.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 13 — ALB details showing two public subnets in two Availability Zones

![](screenshots/ASS5-SC13.png)

---

#### Screenshot 14 — Target group showing at least one healthy target

![](screenshots/ASS5-SC14.png)

---

# Task 6 — Create Auto Scaling Group (ASG) in 2 Public Subnets

## Goal

Create an Auto Scaling Group from the Launch Template across both public subnets, with desired capacity 2, minimum 2, and maximum 4, registered to the ALB target group.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 15 — Auto Scaling Group showing desired, minimum, and maximum capacity and the selected subnet Availability Zones

![](screenshots/ASS5-SC15.png)

---

#### Screenshot 16 — EC2 instances list showing two running instances in different Availability Zones

![](screenshots/ASS5-SC16.png)

---

# Task 7 — Configure App to Use RDS + Validate Read/Write

## Goal

Confirm the application communicates with the RDS database through the ALB DNS name with at least one read and one write operation.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 17 — Browser showing the application loaded through the ALB DNS name with the URL visible

![](screenshots/ASS5-SC17.png)

---

#### Screenshot 18 — Proof of a database write through a UI message or database query output

![](screenshots/ASS5-SC18.png)

---

# Task 8 — High Availability Tests (Must Do Both)

## Goal

Test A: terminate one web instance and confirm the Auto Scaling Group replaces it automatically without interrupting the ALB.

Test B: simulate an Availability Zone impact (stop, detach, or reduce desired capacity in one AZ) and confirm the application stays available.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 19 — EC2 showing the terminated instance and the newly launched instance; timestamps are helpful

![](screenshots/ASS5-SC19.png)

---

#### Screenshot 20 — Target group showing healthy targets after replacement

![](screenshots/ASS5-SC20.png)

---

#### Screenshot 21 — Evidence that an instance was removed, detached, placed in Standby, or stopped in one Availability Zone

![](screenshots/ASS5-SC21.png)

---

#### Screenshot 22 — Browser showing that the ALB DNS endpoint still works during the change

![](screenshots/ASS5-SC22.png)

---

# Task 9 — Architecture and Test-Results Summary

## Goal

Summarize the VPC/subnet layout, the ALB and Auto Scaling Group setup, the private Multi-AZ RDS setup, and the results of both high-availability tests.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 23 — A simple architecture diagram, which may be hand-drawn, or an AWS console overview showing the components

### Notes

Summarize the VPC and subnets across the two Availability Zones.

A single VPC (10.0.0.0/16) hosts two public subnets across two Availability Zones. Both public subnets route 0.0.0.0/0 to an Internet Gateway. A NAT Gateway with an Elastic IP sits in one public subnet for the standard HA pattern, though the EC2 instances ended up with public IPs directly assigned, so they didn't rely on it for outbound access. Traffic flow followed least privilege throughout: internet → ALB security group → EC2 security group (by SG reference, not CIDR) → RDS security group

Summarize the ALB and Auto Scaling Group setup.

An internet-facing Application Load Balancer spans both public subnets and listens on HTTP:80, forwarding to a target group of EC2 instances. The Auto Scaling Group launches from a self-configuring Launch Template whose user data installs Apache/PHP, downloads WordPress, and writes the RDS connection details into wp-config.php on boot — so any replacement instance configures itself automatically. Desired/minimum capacity was set to 2 instances across the two AZs, registered against the ALB's target group with ELB health checks enabled.

Summarize the private Multi-AZ RDS setup.

Unlike the assignment's Multi-AZ requirement, RDS was deployed as a single-AZ MySQL instance due to free-tier limits — no automatic failover, but otherwise correctly placed with public access disabled and the DB security group scoped to accept traffic only from the EC2 security group on port 3306.

Summarize the results of both high-availability tests.

Instance failure test: terminating a web instance triggered the ASG to launch a replacement automatically from the Launch Template; the ALB continued serving traffic throughout, and the target group returned to healthy once the new instance passed its checks
