# Assignment 6 — Capstone: Deploy Book Review App (Three-Tier Architecture) on Azure

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

This is the most important assignment of the course. You will deploy the Book Review App in a production-ready, best-practice-compliant three-tier architecture on Azure: separated presentation, application, and database tiers, least-privilege network access, a controlled public entry point, protected secrets, and availability/monitoring evidence.

---

# Task 1 — Design the Azure Three-Tier Architecture

## Goal

Create an architecture diagram and implementation plan identifying the presentation, application, and database components, the chosen Azure services, the public entry point, and the internal traffic paths.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Architecture diagram showing the public entry point, three tiers, network boundaries, and traffic flow

#### Screenshot 2 — Written architecture assumptions and selected Azure services

---

# Task 2 — Create the Azure Network Foundation

## Goal

Create a dedicated Resource Group and VNet with separate subnets for the web, application, and database tiers, keeping the application and database tiers without direct public access.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Resource Group overview showing the assignment resources

#### Screenshot 4 — VNet overview showing the address space and all required subnets

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Route-table or Private DNS evidence where applicable

![](screenshots/ASS6-SC5.png)

---

# Task 3 — Configure Security and Secret Management

## Goal

Apply least-privilege NSG rules so traffic flows Internet → public entry point → web tier → application tier → database tier, and store credentials in Azure Key Vault or another approved secure mechanism.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — NSG rules proving least-privilege access between the tiers

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Key Vault or approved secret-management configuration (without displaying secret values)

---

# Task 4 — Deploy the Presentation (Web) Tier

## Goal

Deploy the Book Review App presentation layer on the approved web-tier compute service, configured to route requests to the internal application-tier endpoint, and not directly exposed except through the public entry service.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Web-tier compute overview showing subnet and availability configuration

![](screenshots/ASS6-SC8.png)

---

#### Screenshot 9 — Terminal or service output proving the presentation layer is running

![](screenshots/ASS6-SC9.png)

---

# Task 5 — Deploy the Business (Application) Tier

## Goal

Deploy the Book Review App backend privately in the application subnet, configured to use the private database endpoint and secured environment values, reachable only through its internal endpoint.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 10 — Application-tier compute overview showing private subnet placement

![](screenshots/ASS6-SC10.png)

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Backend process, service, or listening-port evidence

![](screenshots/ASS6-SC11.png)

---

#### Screenshot 12 — Internal health-check or API response (without exposing secrets)

![](screenshots/ASS6-SC12.png)

---

# Task 6 — Deploy the Managed Database Tier

## Goal

Create a private Azure managed database (public access disabled), with availability/backup/retention settings, the Book Review App schema imported, and access restricted to the application tier only.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 13 — Database overview showing private connectivity and public access disabled

![](screenshots/ASS6-SC13.png)

---

#### Screenshot 14 — Availability, backup, and retention configuration

![](screenshots/ASS6-SC14.png)

---

#### Screenshot 15 — Successful schema or connectivity verification (without exposing credentials)

![](screenshots/ASS6-SC15.png)

---

# Task 7 — Configure Traffic Management, Availability, and Monitoring

## Goal

Configure the approved public entry service with health probes and backend pools, internal routing for the application tier where required, and enable Azure Monitor/diagnostics/logs/alerts for the key resources.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 16 — Public entry service showing listener, frontend endpoint, and healthy web targets

![](screenshots/ASS6-SC16.png)

---

#### Screenshot 17 — Internal application-tier load-balancing or routing configuration where applicable

![](screenshots/ASS6-SC17.png)

---

#### Screenshot 18 — Azure Monitor, diagnostic settings, logs, metrics, or alert evidence

![](screenshots/ASS6-SC18.png)

---

# Task 8 — Validate the Production-Style Deployment

## Goal

Confirm the Book Review App works end to end through the public endpoint, with at least one database read and one write, confirm private tiers are not internet-reachable, and complete a safe availability test.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 19 — Browser showing the Book Review App through the public endpoint

![](screenshots/ASS6-SC19.png)

---

#### Screenshot 20 — Proof of successful database-backed read and write operations

![](screenshots/ASS6-SC20.png)

---

#### Screenshot 21 — Evidence that private tiers are not publicly accessible

![](screenshots/ASS6-SC21.png)

---

#### Screenshot 22 — Availability-test and healthy-target evidence

![](screenshots/ASS6-SC22.png)

---

#### Public Endpoint

Paste your public endpoint URL here:

`http://20.3.6.254/`

### Notes

Summarize what worked, issues encountered and how they were fixed, and the availability/security/secrets/monitoring/backup choices made.

What worked (architecture, as designed)

1. VNet with 6 segmented subnets — App Gateway, Web, App, DB, Bastion, Private Endpoints — cleanly separating each tier.
2. Application Gateway + WAF_v2 as the sole public entry point; every VM stayed private with no public IPs.
3. Internal Load Balancer distributing traffic across API VMs, keeping the API tier fully private.
4. Azure Bastion for VM access instead of public SSH.
5. MySQL Flexible Server with MySQL-only authentication.
6. Key Vault + Private Endpoint + Private DNS (privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net) for secrets.
7. nginx on the Web VM correctly split traffic: / → local frontend (Next.js, port 3000), /api/ → internal LB → API (port 3001).

Issues encountered and fixes
1. API health checks returned nothing
Root cause; App ran on 3001, but NSG/probe/LB rule still pointed at 3000
Fix; Made every layer consistent on one port
2. LB frontend IP unreachable when tested from an API VM
Root cause; Azure limitation: a backend pool member can't reliably reach its own LB frontend
Fix; Tested from a VM outside the pool (Web VM) instead
3. /health returned 404	
Root cause; Route was only defined at /, not /health
Fix; Added an explicit /health
4. MySQL crashed: ER_TOO_MANY_KEYS
Root cause; sequelize.sync({ alter: true }) added a duplicate email index on every restart, hit MySQL's 64-key cap
Fix; Dropped 62 duplicate indexes via generated SQL and removed alter: true entirely
